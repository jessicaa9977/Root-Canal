5 Signs You Need a Root Canal
More than 15 million root canals are performed each year. But, how do you know if you need a root canal in Dublin, OH? Here are a few tell-tale signs that it’s time to call your dentist.


Root Canal Treat Ment
Tooth Pain
Pain is usually the first sign of something being wrong with your gums and teeth. When you struggle to drink or eat without the pain, you have to see your dentist. If he or she discovers a cavity that has infected your blood vessels and nerves, a root canal might be the solution.

Lumps Near a Tooth
If you become aware of small yellow, reddish, or white lumps in your teeth just over a tooth, then it could possibly be a fistula. The lump is filled with pus and can start draining, leaving a sour flavor in your mouth. It’s a powerful indicator of a disease.

Heat Sensitivity
If you are struggling with hot foods and beverages, it might be a warning signal. A dull ache can advance to extreme tooth ache and it might be a red flag that it is time to stop by your dentist.

A Dark Tooth
Perhaps you have noticed a tooth and becoming darker than the rest? It might be a problem with the guts within your tooth. That happens when the tooth has sustained a injury, like being cracked or chipped.

Swollen Gums
Gum swelling and tenderness will also be red flags which you may require a root canal. The gums around your tooth could swell, which makes you feel as though your enamel is being pushed outside. Normally, the gums are also sensitive to touch or whenever you’re eating.
